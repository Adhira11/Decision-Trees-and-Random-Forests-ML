# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests ðŸŒ²


To explore tree-based models (Decision Trees & Random Forests) for classification using Scikit-learn and Graphviz.


- âœ… Trained a Decision Tree classifier and visualized it using Graphviz
- âœ… Analyzed overfitting and tuned tree depth
- âœ… Trained and evaluated a Random Forest classifier
- âœ… Interpreted feature importances visually
- âœ… Evaluated models using cross-validation


- **Decision Tree Accuracy**: ~XX%
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: ~YY%
- **Cross-validation Scores**:
  - Decision Tree: XX%
  - Random Forest: YY%

View `tree_visualization.png` or open `tree_visualization.dot` with Graphviz.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python decision_tree_rf.py
